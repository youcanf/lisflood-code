## Quick start

You can use conda environment to easily install dependencies.

* Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
* Create a conda env named "lisflood" and install dependencies:

```bash
conda create --name lisflood python=3.7 -c conda-forge
conda activate lisflood
conda install -c conda-forge pcraster
```

* Install lisflood-model pypi package
```bash
pip install lisflood-model
```

Command above will also install the executable `lisflood` in the conda env, so that you can run LISFLOOD with the following:
```bash
lisflood /absolute_path/to/my/local/folder/TestCatchment/settings/cold_day_base.xml
```

You can also clone the repository which contains datasets to test the model.
Follow this instruction for a basic test (included in this repository under [tests/data/TestCatchment1](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-code/tree/master/tests/data/TestCatchment1))

* Clone the master branch of this repository (you need to have git installed on your machine).

```bash
git clone --single-branch --branch master https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-code.git
```

* **Install requirements into a python 3 conda env**

```bash
conda create --name lisflood python=3.7 -c conda-forge
conda activate lisflood
conda install -c conda-forge pcraster
cd lisflood-code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't use conda but a plain virtualenv, you need to install PCRaster and GDAL by your own and include its python interface in PYTHONPATH environment variable.
For details, please follow instruction on [official docs](http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/getting-started/pcraster-on-linux/).


3. Compile the cython module kinematic_wave_parallel_tool

To compile this Cython module to enable OpenMP multithreading (parallel kinematic wave):

* Delete the files *.so (if any) in directory hydrological-modules  

* Inside the hydrological_modules folder, execute "python compile_kinematic_wave_parallel_tools.py build_ext --inplace"  

Important: the module has to be compiled on the machine where the model is run - the resulting binary is not portable.  

Then in the settings file the option "numberParallelThreadsKinematicWave" may take the following values:
    - "0"           : auto-detection of the machine/node's number of CPUs (all CPUs are used minus 1) (do not set it if other simulations are running on the same machine/node)
    - "1"           : serial execution (not parallel)
    - "2", "3", ... : manual setting of the number of parallel threads.
                      (if exceeding the number of CPUs, the option is set to "0") -->  
```xml
<textvar name="numCPUs_parallelKinematicWave" value="3"/>
```
4. Run a cold run for the test catchment

Now your environment should be set up to run lisflood. Try with a prepared settings file for one of the two test catchments:

```bash
python src/lisf1.py tests/data/TestCatchment/settings/cold_day_base.xml
```

If the command above successed without errors, producing dis.nc into tests/data/TestCatchment1/outputs folder, your lisflood installation was correct.

### Docker image

You can use the updated docker image to run lisflood, so without taking care to install dependencies on your system.

#### Pull image from repository:

```bash
docker pull efas/lisflood:latest
```

#### Run test catchments in image:

```bash
docker run -v /absolute_path/to/my/local/folder:/usecases efas/lisflood:latest usecases
```

After this command, you can find all files to run a test against a catchment under the directory you mapped: `/absolute_path/to/my/local/folder/TestCatchment1`


Now, you can run LISFLOOD as a docker container to test included catchments. Only thing you need to do is to map the TestCatchment1 folder to the container folder `input`, by using -v option. 
In the XML settings file, all paths are adjusted to be relative to the very same settings file, so you don't need to edit paths, as long as you keep same folders structure.


#### Execute lisflood with a Docker image:

```bash
docker run -v /absolute_path/to/my/local/folder/TestCatchment:/input efas/lisflood /input/settings/cold_day_base.xml
```

Once LISFLOOD finished, you find reported maps in `/absolute_path/to/my/local/folder/TestCatchment/outputs/` folder.

### Pypi packaged LISFLOOD

LISFLOOD is also distributed as a standard python package. You can install the pip package in your Python 3 virtualenv:

```bash
pip install lisflood-model
```

Command above will also install the executable `lisflood` in the virtualenv, so that you can run LISFLOOD with the following:

```bash
lisflood /absolute_path/to/my/local/folder/TestCatchment/settings/cold_day_base.xml
```

## Collaborate

If you find an issue in our code, please follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to propose your changes (Fork, commit your changes and ask for a Pull Request).
When you develop, you need to run our unit tests before to propose a pull request.
Simply execute `tox` or `pytest` on command line from project folder.

Tox tests can last minutes. You can also just use pytest and run tests in a single environment (e.g. Python 3.7).
This is often enough and will save you some time if you need to run tests frequently.
 
`pytest tests/ -x -l -ra`

See [official website](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for more info about pytest.
